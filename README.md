# GigPilot (Job Posting App)
This repository contains the code for a Job Posting App, a platform designed to streamline the process of job hunting and hiring. Users can search for jobs, apply with their resumes, and recruiters can post job listings. The application features JWT authentication for secure access, a Node.js backend, MongoDB for database management, and Vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.

# Features
- User Authentication: Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
- Job Search: Users can search for jobs based on various criteria such as location, job title, or keywords.
- Resume Upload: Applicants can upload their resumes directly through the app to apply for jobs seamlessly.
- Job Posting: Recruiters can post job listings, providing details such as job title, description, requirements, and contact information.

# Technologies Used
- Node.js: Backend runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js used to build the backend server.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used to store user profiles, job listings, resumes, and other relevant data.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Frontend development without the use of any additional libraries or frameworks.
